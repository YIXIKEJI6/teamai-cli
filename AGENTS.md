# TeamAI CLI

## Organization fork policy

This fork delivers the central usage service tracked by YIXIKEJI6/teamai-cli#1.
Its PRs target this fork only. Use the assigned isolated checkout and the stable
developer branch `codex/JohnDuncan5171`; retain that branch after merge. No new
worktrees or per-issue/role/round remote branches for this work. The central UI
is Chinese; existing CLI output stays English. Public code and evidence contain
only generic configuration and synthetic identities. Never publish this fork to
npm, enable production deployment triggers, or copy private operational material.
These approved fork rules override the corresponding upstream Git and UI rules
below. Independent acceptance is required before merge; implementation does not
authorize self-merge. Preserve upstream licensing and Git/resource behavior.

CLI for syncing team skills, rules, docs, and env across AI coding tools. Package: [`teamai-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/teamai-cli).

TypeScript, Node 20+, tsup (ESM), Vitest. Commands: `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx vitest run`.

## Git

- Default branch: `main`. Worktrees and PRs based on `origin/main`.
- PR only to `Tencent/teamai-cli`. Before push, check `git log origin/main..HEAD`; rebase or cherry-pick if unrelated commits appear.
- **必须使用 Worktree**：改代码前先 `EnterWorktree`，禁止在主工作目录修改。

## Rules

- CLI user-facing output must be English. No Chinese in production code. Tests assert English output.
- Keep bilingual docs in sync (`README` / `*.zh-CN.md`, `docs/usage-guide.*`). Behavior changes must update every affected doc (including `docs/designs/`); grep old wording before opening the PR.
- **奥卡姆剃刀**：避免过早添加新 CLI 命令；非必要不加；优先复用或扩展现有命令与选项。

## PR 前测试

`npm run build` 后用真实 CLI 对本次改动做完整端到端验证（不能只跑 type check / unit test）。Test Plan 每一项必须实际通过，测试报告贴进 PR。
